Tracking the Unusual Whales Subversive ETFs vs the S&amp;P 500

## About the ETFs
It is very common for people on both sides of the political spectrum to
complain about the stock trades that are made by politicians, usually by
members of the opposing party.  The main idea of these complaints is that
members of the political class are using their privileged information to make
unethical profits that normal investors could not hope to make.  The good folks
over at [Unusual Whales](https://unusualwhales.com/etfs/congress) have put
some nice EFTs together so you can invest like an elected official.

## My Thoughts About This
The combination of these ETFs and the proliferation of powerful and free 
analytics tools made me think that it would be very easy to see if people
in congress were actually beating the market or not.  I put together a quick
and dirty Jupyter notebook that plots the daily percent change of the two
political ETFs along with the S&P 500, and compares the total percent change
as well.  Based on the data I have been able to grab, the ETFs came into being
on *February 7th, 2023*.  As of right now (April 26th, 2023) the S&P is 
actually doing better than both of these ETFs.  If this remains true over the
long term it will say some very interesting things about [passive investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_management)
and [the efficient market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).
